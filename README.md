# MorseEncoder

Just a simple C project (with some C++ string and input/output methods used).
Example of creating and using linked lists and dynamic memory allocation in C.
Each encoded letter will be stored in memory as a linked list. When a new letter is added,
the needed memory is dynamically allocated to use only the needed memory.

Does not take into account the risk of memory overflow.
